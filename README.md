### Chest X_rays Diagnosis
**this project is on exploration of medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras.
the dataset is available [here](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC).
the following tasks were performed:**
1. Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset
2. Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification
3. Learn a technique to handle class imbalance
4. Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve
5. Visualize model activity using GradCAMs
